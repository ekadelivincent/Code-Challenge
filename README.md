In the first question(1.js), I have written a code that explains the grades of individual students. This functions prompts the user to input student marks between 0 and 100 and outputs the corresponding grade 
In the second question (2.js), this function prompts the user to input the speed of a vehicle and outputs "ok" if the speed is less than 70 whereas when the speed is above 70on for every 5 km above 70, it should give the user one demerit point and print the total number of demerits
